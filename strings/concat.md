# Concatenation

Concatenation involves adding two or more strings together, creating a larger string containing the combined data of those original strings. This is done in JavaScript using the **+** operator.

```js
var bigStr = 'Hi ' + 'JS strings are nice ' + 'and ' + 'easy to add';
```

var firstName = "John";
var lastName = "Smith";

var fullName =
```

```js
var firstName = "John";
var lastName = "Smith";

var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
```

```js
alert(fullName === 'John Smith');
```
