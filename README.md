## About Javascript
JavaScript is a programming language used to make webpages interactive. It is what gives a page lifeâ€”the interactive elements and animation that engage a user. If you've ever used a search box on a home page, checked a live baseball score on a news site, or watched a video, JavaScript is probably running through it.

This book will teach you the basics of programming and Javascript. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this book is intended for everyone who wishes to learn the JavaScript programming language.
