# Linked Lists 

In all programming languages, there are data structures. One of these data structures are called Linked Lists. There is no built in method or function for Linked Lists in Javascript so you will have to implement it yourself. 

A Linked List is very similar to a normal array in Javascript, it just acts a little bit differently. 

In this chapter, we will go over the different ways we can implement a Linked List. 

Here's an example of a Linked List: 

```
["one", "two", "three", "four"]
```
