# Basics about Programming

In this first chapter we'll learn the basics of programming and the Javascript language.

Programming means writing code. A book is made up of chapters, paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words, punctuation, and letters. Likewise, a program can be broken down into smaller and smaller components. For now the most important component is a statement. A statement is analogous to a sentence in a book. On its own it has structure and purpose, but it is meaningless without the context of the other statements around it.

A statement is more casually (and commonly) known as a *line of code*. That's because statements tend to be written on individual lines. As such, programs can be read from top to bottom and left to right. You might be wondering what code (also called source code) is. Code is a broad term that can refer to something as large as a whole program or as small as a line in that program. For instance, a line of code is simply a line of your program.

Here is a simple example:

```javascript
var hello = "Hello";
var world = "World";

// Message equals "Hello World"
var message = hello + " " + world;
```

This code can be executed by another program called an *interpreter* that will read the code and execute all the statements in the right order.
