# Creation

There are two ways to create an `object` in JavaScript:

1. literal

   ```js
   var object = {};
   // Yes, simply a pair of curly braces!
   ```

   > **_Note:_** this is the **recommended** way.

2. and object-oriented

   ```js
   var object = new Object();
   ```

   > **_Note:_** it's almost like Java.
