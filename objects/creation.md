# Creation
There are two ways to create an `object` in JavaScript.

1. Literal:

    ```js
    var object = {};
     // Yes, simply a pair of curly braces!

    ```
***Note:*** this is the **recomended** way.

2. Object-oriented:

    ```js
    var object = new Object();

    ```
***Note:*** it's almost like Java.
